# Text-to-Speech Python Script

This project is a Python script that converts text into speech and plays the resulting audio. It utilizes the `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) library to generate speech from text and the `playsound3` library to play the generated audio file.

## Features

- Converts text input into speech using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- Saves the speech as an `.mp3` file.
- Plays the saved speech file using the `playsound3` library.

## Requirements

To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `gTTS`: Google Text-to-Speech.
- `playsound3`: To play the audio.
- `speech_recognition`: This is imported in the script but not used in this version.
- `os` and `time`: These libraries are built into Python but are not used in this version of the script.

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:
```bash
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound3
pip install SpeechRecognition
